## introduction to using a terminal
##### Way back in the old days of computing, before graphical user interfaces (GUIs) became the norm, the only way to use a computer was through a so-called command line interface. These simple text prompts allowed computer users to key in their commands using a language that was more familiar to the computer, and encouraged us to have a more solid understanding of how the machine interprets the metaphors with which we ask it to perform tasks for us.
### the command line
##### The command line is a powerful tool used by developers to find, create, and manipulate files and folders.and it's a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
##### Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) come in many forms. The CLI weâ€™ll use is called Bash.
 ##### The command line is an interesting beast,  Don't think of it as leaving the GUI behind so much as adding to it. While you can leave the GUI alltogether, most people open up a command line interface just as another window on their desktop (in fact you can have as many open as you like). This is also to our advantage as we can have several command lines open and doing different tasks in each at the same time. We can also easily jump back to the GUI when it suits us.
 ### navigation 
#####   the basics of moving around the system. Many tasks rely on being able to get to, or reference the correct location in the system. 
##### We often navigate the filesystem graphically by clicking on graphical folders. We can do the exact same navigation from the terminal.

##### There are two commands that we'll be using in the PowerShell terminal to navigate the filesystem on your computer:

##### ls
##### cd
##### ls lists the contents of a directory.
##### cd moves you into a new directory (it stands for "change directory").

### about files
##### everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file (one that the system reads from only), your monitor is a file (one that the system writes to only) etc. To begin with.
##### lets talk about extension and Case Sensitive
##### extension: Windows the extension is important and the system uses it to determine what type of file it is. Under Linux the system actually ignores the extension and looks inside the file to determine what type of file it is
##### file.exe - an executable file, or program.
##### file.txt - a plain text file.
##### file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
##### case sensitive : Text or typed input that is sensitive to capitalization of letters. For example, "Computer" and "computer" are two different words because the "C" is uppercase in the first example and lowercase in the second example. On modern systems, passwords are case-sensitive, and usernames are usually case-sensitive as well.
