**my own word to explain growth mindset.**

*growth mindset is based on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts.*




**3 reminders for me to keep my self in a growth mindset**


- i have to View challenges as opportunities
- Try different learning tactics
- and Replace the word “failing” with the word “learning.”
