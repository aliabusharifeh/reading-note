# what is Git?


**Git is an Open Source Distributed Version Control System and there is a lot of words to define Git.**

**Control System :**  *basically means that Git is a content tracker.*

**Version Control System :**   *allows to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes*

**Distributed Version Control System :**    *Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer. This means that the code is not just stored in a central server*

**Why need a Version Control System like Git?**    *Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel. So a version control system like Git is needed to ensure there are no code conflicts between the developers.*

**Additionally, the requirements in such projects change often. So a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of the code.**

**Finally, sometimes several projects which are being run in parallel involve the same codebase. In such a case, the concept of branching in Git is very important.**
