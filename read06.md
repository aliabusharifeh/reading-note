# Programming with JavaScript


#### JavaScript is the most popular and widely used client-side scripting language. Client-side scripting refers to scripts that run within your web browser. JavaScript is designed to add interactivity and dynamic effects to the web pages by manipulating the content returned from a web server.

## operators: 

#### JavaScript has the following types of operators. This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.

- Assignment operators
- Comparison operators
- Arithmetic operators
- Bitwise operators
- Logical operators
- String operators
- Conditional (ternary) operator
- Comma operator
- Unary operators
- Relational operators
#### JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator.
## expression:

#### An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

#### Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value but conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects (for example: those that assign value to a variable) and those that in some sense evaluate and therefore resolve to a value.

#### The expression x = 7 is an example of the first type. This expression uses the = operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to seven.

#### The code 3 + 4 is an example of the second expression type. This expression uses the + operator to add three and four together without assigning the result, seven, to a variable.

#### JavaScript has the following expression categories:

#### Arithmetic: evaluates to a number, for example 3.14159. (Generally uses arithmetic operators.)
#### String: evaluates to a character string, for example, "Fred" or "234". (Generally uses string operators.)
#### Logical: evaluates to true or false. (Often involves logical operators.)
#### Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.
#### Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.


## Functions
#### Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.

#### Defining functions :
- Function declarations
- Function expressions
- Calling functions
